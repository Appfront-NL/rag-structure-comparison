A total of 22751/25039 duplicate texts were found during encoding. Only encoding unique text and duplicating embeddings across.
Error while evaluating AlloprofReranking: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 8.00 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 11.91 GiB of which 636.62 MiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 11.29 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 11.13 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 47.94 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management  (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#environment-variables)
